# MIDP_Check
This script allows automated check of Jacobs drawings title block info (Drawings numbers,Drawings titles, Drawing status, Suitability and Revision) in an MIDP with pdf copies of the drawings.

The code produces a new excel file "MIDP_check_list.xlsx" with the check results. Discrepancy in a drawing title is highlighted in YELLOW in this file and a missing drawing number in MIDP is highlighted in RED.

For this script to work, it is required that WORK IN PROGRES RED BANNER is removed from drawings before running this script.

It is recommended to save the drawings to be checked on a local drive (i.e. not in Teams/SharePoint folder)
